abstract = {Here, we present a novel mechano-spectroscopic atomic force microscopy (AFM-MS) technique that overcomes the limitations of current spectroscopic methods by combining the high-resolution imaging capabilities of AFM with machine learning (ML) classification. AFM-MS employs AFM operating in sub-resonance tapping imaging mode, which enables the collection of multiple physical and mechanical property maps of a sample with sub-nanometer lateral resolution in a highly repeatable manner. By comparing these properties to a database of known materials, the technique identifies the location of constituent materials at each image pixel with the assistance of ML algorithms. We demonstrate AFM-MS on various material mixtures, achieving an unprecedented lateral spectroscopic resolution of 1.6 nm. This powerful approach opens new avenues for nanoscale material study, including the material identification and correlation of nanostructure with macroscopic material properties. The ability to map material composition with such high resolution will significantly advance the understanding and design of complex, nanostructured materials.}

title={Transfer Learning with Informative Priors: Simple Baselines Better than Previously Reported},
author={Harvey\(^{*}\), Ethan and Petrov\(^{*}\), Mikhail and Hughes, Michael C.},
journal={Transactions on Machine Learning Research},
year={2024},
html={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BbvSU02jLg},
abstract = {We pursue transfer learning to improve classifier accuracy on a target task with few labeled examples available for training.
Recent work suggests that using a source task to learn a prior distribution over neural net weights, not just an initialization, can boost target task performance.
In this study, we carefully compare transfer learning with and without source task informed priors across 5 datasets.
We find that standard transfer learning informed by an initialization only performs far better than reported in previous comparisons.
The relative gains of methods using informative priors over standard transfer learning vary in magnitude across datasets.
For the scenario of 5-300 examples per class, we find negative or negligible gains on 2 datasets, modest gains (between 1.5-3 points of accuracy) on 2 other datasets, and substantial gains (>8 points) on one dataset.
Among methods using informative priors, we find that an isotropic covariance appears competitive with learned low-rank covariance matrix while being substantially simpler to understand and tune.
Further analysis suggests that the mechanistic justification for informed priors -- hypothesized improved alignment between train and test loss landscapes -- is not consistently supported due to high variability in empirical landscapes.
We release code to allow independent reproduction of all experiments.},

title = {Machine Learning Allows for Distinguishing Precancerous and Cancerous Human Epithelial Cervical Cells Using High-Resolution AFM Imaging of Adhesion Maps},
journal = {Cells},

html = {https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/12/21/2536},
abstract = {Previously, the analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM) images allowed us to distinguish normal from cancerous/precancerous human epithelial cervical cells using only the fractal dimension parameter. High-resolution maps of adhesion between the AFM probe and the cell surface were used in that study. However, the separation of cancerous and precancerous cells was rather poor (the area under the curve (AUC) was only 0.79, whereas the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 74%, 58%, and 84%, respectively). At the same time, the separation between premalignant and malignant cells is the most significant from a clinical point of view. Here, we show that the introduction of machine learning methods for the analysis of adhesion maps allows us to distinguish precancerous and cancerous cervical cells with rather good precision (AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 0.93, 83%, 92%, and 78%, respectively). Substantial improvement in sensitivity is significant because of the unmet need in clinical practice to improve the screening of cervical cancer (a relatively low specificity can be compensated by combining this approach with other currently existing screening methods). The random forest decision tree algorithm was utilized in this study. The analysis was carried out using the data of six precancerous primary cell lines and six cancerous primary cell lines, each derived from different humans. The robustness of the classification was verified using K-fold cross-validation (K = 500). The results are statistically significant at p < 0.0001. Statistical significance was determined using the random shuffle method as a control.},

journal = {Biomedicines},

html = {https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/1/191},
abstract = {It has been recently demonstrated that atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows for the rather precise identification of malignancy in bladder and cervical cells. Furthermore, an example of human colorectal epithelial cells imaged in AFM Ringing mode has demonstrated the ability to distinguish cells with varying cancer aggressiveness with the help of machine learning (ML). The previously used ML methods analyzed the entire cell image. The problem with such an approach is the lack of information about which features of the cell surface are associated with a high degree of aggressiveness of the cells. Here we suggest a machine-learning approach to overcome this problem. Our approach identifies specific geometrical regions on the cell surface that are critical for classifying cells as highly or lowly aggressive. Such localization gives a path to colocalize the newly identified features with possible clustering of specific molecules identified via standard bio-fluorescence imaging. The biological interpretation of the obtained information is discussed.},

abstract = {Using first-principles calculations in combination with the Eliashberg formalism, we systematically investigated phonon-mediated superconductivity in two-dimensional (2D) metal-boride crystals, consisting of a boron honeycomb network doped by diverse metal elements. Such 2D metal-boride compounds, named MBenes, are chemically exfoliable from single-crystalline layered ternary borides. First we identified the MBene layers with potential for superconductivity via isotropic Eliashberg calculations, considering a wide range of metal elements, with a focus on alkaline earth and transition metals. Subsequently, we performed a detailed analysis of the prominent superconducting MBenes by solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equations. The obtained high critical temperatures (up to 72 K), as well as the rich multigap superconducting behavior, recommend these crystals for further use in multifunctional 2D heterostructures and superconducting device applications.},

journal = {2D Materials},
pdf = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01031},
abstract = {Among the large variety of two-dimensional (2D) materials discovered to date, elemental monolayers that host superconductivity are very rare. Using ab initio calculations we show that recently synthesized gallium monolayers, coined gallenene, are intrinsically superconducting through electron–phonon coupling. We reveal that Ga-100 gallenene, a planar monolayer isostructural with graphene, is the structurally simplest 2D superconductor to date, furthermore hosting topological edge states due to its honeycomb structure. Our anisotropic Eliashberg calculations show distinctly three-gap superconductivity in Ga-100, in contrast to the alternative buckled Ga-010 gallenene which presents a single anisotropic superconducting gap. Strikingly, the critical temperature (T\(_{\mathrm{c}}\)) of gallenene is in the range of 7–10 K, exceeding the T\(_{\mathrm{c}}\) of bulk gallium from which it is exfoliated. Finally we explore chemical functionalization of gallenene with hydrogen, and report induced multigap superconductivity with an enhanced T\(_{\mathrm{c}}\) in the resulting gallenane compound.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-based compounds under ultrahigh pressure, such as the polyhydrides H\(_3\)S and LaH\(_{10}\), superconduct through the conventional electron-phonon coupling mechanism to attain the record critical temperatures known to date. Here we exploit the intrinsic advantages of hydrogen to strongly enhance phonon-mediated superconductivity in a completely different system, namely, a two-dimensional material with hydrogen adatoms. We find that van Hove singularities in the electronic structure, originating from atomiclike hydrogen states, lead to a strong increase of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, and thus of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, the emergence of high-frequency hydrogen-related phonon modes in this system boosts the electron-phonon coupling further. As a concrete example, we demonstrate the effect of hydrogen adatoms on the superconducting properties of monolayer MgB\(_2\), by solving the fully anisotropic Eliashberg equations, in conjunction with a first-principles description of the electronic and vibrational states, and their coupling. We show that hydrogenation leads to a high critical temperature of 67 K, which can be boosted to over 100 K by biaxial tensile strain.},

The spectrum contains a wide band with peaks centered at 662, 715, 940, and 1274nm. Relative contributions to the spectrum from different sources have been evaluated. Ratio of the singlet oxygen signal to the total signal intensity averaged over the 1240–1300nm spectral range was determined to be 40%. Isolation of the singlet oxygen signal from the total signal at 1274nm has been achieved by means of a spectral-resolved TCSPC detection technique.},
