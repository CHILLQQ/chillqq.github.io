Currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Tufts University, with a strong interdisciplinary background spanning computational physics, nanophysics, and applied AI. My main interests are:

* Machine learning for health
* Bayesian deep learning
* Numerical simulations of materials from first principles (Density Functional theory)
* Atomic force microscopy
